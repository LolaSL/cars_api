I understand that you want to embed a video as the background using a URL. However, embedding videos directly as background images is not straightforward using CSS alone. The backgroundImage property is specifically designed to work with images, not videos.

If you want to display a video as a background, you might need to use HTML5's <video> element and CSS to position and style it. Unfortunately, embedding an external video directly from a URL as a background is not a common practice due to technical limitations and potential performance issues.

Here's how you can create a simple example of a video background using a local video file:

Place your video file in the public directory of your Next.js project (e.g., video.mp4).

Create a new component named VideoBackground.js:

jsx
Copy code
import React from "react";
import globals from "../app/styles/globals.css";
import Link from "next/link";
import "../public/styles.css"; // Import the styles.css file

const VideoBackground = () => {
  return (
    <div className={`min-h-screen m-4 py-6 ${globals}`}>
      <div className="video-container">
        <video autoPlay muted loop className="video">
          <source src="/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
        <div className="text-overlay">
          <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Contact Us</h1>
          <p>Please fill in the form below</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* Rest of your content */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default VideoBackground;
